# Power BI Project for Sales Insights

`Overview`
This project focuses on data analysis to generate sales insights for a computer hardware manufacturer, AtliQ Hardware. It aims to provide hands-on experience in executing data analysis projects in a corporate environment, which is valuable for aspiring data analysts and scientists.

## Project Breakdown

`1. Problem Statement`

AtliQ Hardware supplies computer hardware to clients across India and faces challenges in tracking sales due to dynamic market conditions. The sales director, Bhavan Patel, struggles with obtaining clear insights from regional managers, who often provide verbal reports that may not accurately reflect the sales data.

`2.Challenges Identified`

The reliance on verbal communication leads to a lack of trust in the data provided. Managers tend to sugarcoat the facts, resulting in confusion and frustration for Bhavan Patel, who seeks straightforward, digestible insights rather than numerous Excel files.
The need for a visual dashboard is emphasized, as it would allow Bhavan to quickly assess sales trends and make data-driven decisions.

`3.Project Execution Steps`

The project will be divided into several parts, starting with defining the problem and strategy using the Ames grid. Subsequent steps include data discovery, cleaning, merging, and ultimately creating a Power BI dashboard.

`4. Expected Outcomes`

The end product will be a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that tracks revenue and sales quantities year-over-year, providing insights by region and product. Participants will also receive the dashboard and act as stakeholders, providing feedback for improvements.

`5. Importance of Data Visualization`

A well-structured dashboard will enable Bhavan Patel to visualize sales data effectively, allowing for timely and informed decision-making. This aligns with the principle that "a picture is worth a thousand words," emphasizing the need for clear data representation.

`6. Conclusion`

This project not only aims to enhance technical skills in Power BI but also focuses on understanding the corporate context of data analysis.
